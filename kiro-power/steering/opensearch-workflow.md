## OpenSearch Search Builder

You have access to the `opensearch-orchestrator` MCP server via the `opensearch-search-builder` power.

When the user's request involves building a search application or OpenSearch architecture, activate the `opensearch-search-builder` power and follow its workflow phases in order.

Key rules:
- Ask ONE preference question per message
- Never skip Phase 1 (sample document collection)
- Show planner proposals verbatim
